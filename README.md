# How to Install Nvidia Drivers on Ubuntu

* Determine the current video driver. In this case it is `nouveau`
```
# lshw -c video

       vendor: Intel Corporation
       physical id: 2
       bus info: pci@0000:00:02.0
       version: 06
       width: 64 bits
       clock: 33MHz
       capabilities: msi pm vga_controller bus_master cap_list rom
       configuration: driver=i915 latency=0
       resources: irq:49 memory:f7400000-f77fffff memory:d0000000-dfffffff ioport:f000(size=64)
```
* Disable the nouveau driver by creating a `nvidia-installer-disable-nouveau.conf` in the `/etc/modprobe.d/` directory. The contents should look like this:

```
# generated by nvidia-installer
blacklist nouveau
options nouveau modeset=0
```

* Reboot system using the `init 2` command which is single user mode with network capabilities. You don't want X windows running.

* Run the `ubuntu-drivers devices` command to determine the available drivers.
```
